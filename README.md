### Modular Pages via Contentful
This demo is a proof of concept for "modular pages" controlled through a headless CMS. Contentful content models are created, that represent modular building blocks of a page. In React each of these content models is mapped to a React component, so that the page can be "assembled" dynamically based on the response from the CMS.

### Web Audio API Karaoke
This tech demo was thrown together for a pitch some time around 2012/2013 during my time at [B-Reel](https://www.b-reel.com). It is built around the use of the Web Audio API and was supposed to be a fun mini game for the TV show "The Voice". Since the show is a singing contest, the game requires the user to hit the perfect pitch by matching up staff lines.

### Second Screen with Next.js and socket.io 
This demo showcases the concept of a second screen experience, implemented with Next.js and socket.io. After opening the demo simultaneously on two separate devices, the devices can connect and exchange information in realtime. There's a wide spectrum of different use cases for second screen applications.
