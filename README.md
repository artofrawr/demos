### Web Audio API Karaoke
This tech demo was thrown together for a pitch some time around 2012/2013 during my time at [B-Reel](https://www.b-reel.com). It is built around the use of the Web Audio API and was supposed to be a fun mini game for the TV show "The Voice". Since the show is a singing contest, the game requires the user to hit the perfect pitch by matching up staff lines.
